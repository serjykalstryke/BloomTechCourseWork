//Passing Data into Functions

//Let's return to our cookie example. Pretend that you want your robot to bake different types of cookies. Do you need to write a new function for each type of cookie? No! You can pass in arguments to your function to change the behavior of the function. Consider the following:

function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

add(2,2)
add(4,5)
